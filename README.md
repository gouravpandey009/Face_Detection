# Face_Detection
The objective of the program given is to detect object of interest(face) in real time and to keep tracking of the same object.
Absolutely! Here's the objective of the program broken down into bullet points for easy readability:

- **Objective:** 
  - Detect faces in real-time using Python and OpenCV.
  - Implement object tracking to keep track of the detected faces.

- **Key Features:**
  - Real-time Face Detection: Utilize OpenCV library to detect faces in live video streams or recorded video files.
  - Haar Cascade Classifier: Employ the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for efficient face detection.
  - Object Tracking: Implement algorithms such as Kalman Filters or centroid tracking to track the movement of detected faces over time.
  - User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface to display the live video feed with real-time face detection and tracking overlays.

- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Initialize the video capture device to access live camera feed or load a recorded video file.
  2. Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.
  3. Process each frame of the video feed:
     - Detect faces using the Haar Cascade classifier.
     - Apply object tracking algorithm to track the detected faces.
     - Draw bounding boxes around the detected faces and display them in the video feed.
  4. Continuously update the tracking information as the faces move within the frame.
  5. Display the processed video feed with real-time face detection and tracking.

- **Usage:**
  - Run the Python script to start the face detection and tracking program.
  - Provide access to the camera or specify the path to the video file if using recorded footage.
  - Monitor the output to observe real-time face detection and tracking in the video feed.

- **Dependencies:**
  - Python
  - OpenCV library
  - Haar Cascade classifier file for face detection
